# Goals
This is a list of the career paths/companies I would love to work for.
- Apple
- Microsoft
- Google
- IGN
These are just a few examples of dream jobs that come to mind and seem ideal. I would honeslty be very happy starting out anywhere as long as I can somewhat enjoy the work I am doing and get paid well enough. Down the road sometime, my goal is to start my own business. What I wish to do I am not sure yet but the idea of working for myself and creating something that I am proud of does seem very ideal.
